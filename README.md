# Palette Pal

This is a tool to make and manage palettes of color swatches.
Swatches are defined as curves on a plane in a selected color space.

By allowing easy duplication of color curves across several different hues, it's easy to make colors in the palette compatible with each other.

## Export formats

Palette Pal can export to several known formats, including PAL, dwind, tailwind and PNG.
This allows easy integration with the dwind and tailwind CSS stacks, as well as Aseprite for pixel artist.
